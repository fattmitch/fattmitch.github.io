# Project: Wedding Venue Template

Wedding Venues seem to have it all. Picturesque scenery, beautiful backdrops, and breathtaking views. However, for some venues, that's where it all stops. I've seen many venues with downright terrible websites. That's why I've created a wedding venue website, that features an elegant **single page scroll** and **photo gallery** that pulls photos from a Flickr account to easily show prospective customers the beauty of their venue.

Wedding Venues: If you'd like to update your site and don't know where to start, please [contact me](/index#contact) if you'd like to learn more.
