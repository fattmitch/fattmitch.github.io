    <p>Just wanted to put a little webpage together to wish you a happy Fathers Day! Thanks for all that you have sacraficed over the years. That's for teaching me what a selfless love should look like, both for your childen and wife. I continue to count my blessings that my childhood memories are ones where you're included, and not wishing my dad were there. Thanks for all the unwaivering support! We miss you so and can't wait for our vacay soon! Love you mucho!</p>

    <h2>Anyway... here's a fun poem for you</h2>
    <p class="poem">There is a Dad
      <br>Who is extremely rad
      <br>He is there all the time
      <br>And could always make a good rhyme
      <br>He instilled in his tikes
      <br>A love for nature and bikes
      <br>And so I just want say
      <br>I love you, Happy Fathers Day!
    </p>
    <h1>Love YOU!</h1>
