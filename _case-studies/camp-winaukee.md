### Quick Deploy Site

#### Summary
Built using one of the Typewriter templates, Camp Winaukee needed a new site but were on budget. No time for Sketch mock ups? No problem! Camp Winaukee's new site is clean, modern, fast and easy on the pocket book.

#### Braggin Rights
I was proud of how good the site looks considering the budget/time crunch I was under to complete it. With no time for Sketch mock ups, I dove straight into the code and designed as I built using examples from the Invision inspiration board we put together with the client. The content in the site is easy to digest, the fonts are sharp, the colors pop, and the client was happy!
