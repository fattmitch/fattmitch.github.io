# Email Marketing and Newsletter Templates
---

I've worked with clients that use Campaign Monitor for their email marketing needs. Campaign monitor has a handy interface called Canvas that allows users to create (mostly) responsive email. Taking cues from newly redesigned sites, I was able to create email marketing/newsletter templates that were on brand.

## Email Templates vs. Original Camp Websites

Below are two different examples of email templates I've designed. One is for Camp Highlander, the other is for Camp Somerset (both websites I also designed). I was able to match the look and feel of each site, however, since email clients are 10 years behind website standards I had to make a few concessions.

The two main concessions were custom fonts and responsivity (yes, I made that word up). I matched fonts in these custom emails as closely as possible to their respective webfonts using only system fonts. Also, I had to create assets knowing that email clients don't support media queries, I had to make sure photos would scale to all viewport sizes nicely. Take a closer look below:
