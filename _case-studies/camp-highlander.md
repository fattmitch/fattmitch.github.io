# Site: Camp Highlander
---

Currently still in development, the Highlander website was a joy to design. I love the simple elegance and focus on photography. I also enjoy the amount of portrait oriented photography that will be featured on the site.

One challenge this site provided for me was the color palette. Highlander has set camp colors: two shades of green, and two shades of brown. At first, I hated working with these colors, but I was able to find a way to work in the brown and greens in a way that wasn't painful on the yes. The unsaturated photos with green/brown overlays is a touch that I am proud of.

Slated to be released later this year, check back in a bit to see the entire site.
