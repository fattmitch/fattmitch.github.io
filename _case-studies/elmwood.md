### Signature Website
---

#### Summary
Like most clients, Elmwood Day Camp had an old, outdated site. They wanted a fancy pants new site, so we built them one. The design was more of a 'revolution' vs. 'evolution'. We even refined their logo in the process to go better with their cleaner, more modern website.

#### Braggin Rights
Designing a website that's trying to appeal to children as well as adults is tough. It's very tough. Children and adults aren't the same. I feel the the balance we struck with Elmwood does a good job at bridging the gap. The colors are childish, but the presentation is clean and sleak. The dots behind the heroes are playful, but the cardified content boxes do a good job in corraling the user.
