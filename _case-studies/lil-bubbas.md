# Project: Lil Bubba's Bows

Lil Bubba's Bows was a company my wife co-founded. They sold hand made bows to local retail stores. Although, they never fully planned to ramp the business up (it was more for fun) I thought it would be fun to design her an eCommerce shop. While the store was never intended to launch, I learned alot in the process.

## Wireframes
---

I started the process with wireframes using **Balsamiq**.  The first step develop a site map. I kept it simple, giving the site a one level of categorization (simple product line), an about page, a contact page, a shopping cart and a checkout page.

Next, I wireframed the home page. I wanted to provide as much rich content as possible, and at the same time, make it easy for users to shop on the site, which is why I made the decision to add a rotating slider at the top of the page. This would allow my Lil Bubba's to show different products and promotions, without taking up valueable page real estate.

After the home page, I wireframed two versions of a product listing page. One utilized a left hand nav, while the other stuck with the top nav. After running a few user tests, I decided to use only a top navigation structure on the site. The reason behind this decision was becuase their product line was very simple (three categories) so I felt that the space taken up by the left nav wasn't put to good use. Instead of putting the product filter in the left nav, I moved it above the product thumbnails.

Left nav:

Top nav:

I also decided to wireframe the mobile version of the product listing page featuring a slide out navigation menu:

## Font Selection
---

I wanted something playful yet elegant for Little Bubba's Bows header font so I decided to choose a script. As the target customer of Little Bubba's Bows was mostly moms and grandmas, I wanted to show a feminine side to the site. I ended up choosing dancing script for the category selectors only. Too much script can cause readability issues. For the body of the site, I chose something a little more playful (Alegreya Sans), as I thought that the playfulness of the font matched the product Lil Bubba's Bows was trying to sell. Both are available on Google Fonts for free.

## Mockups

Once I had the fonts selected, it was time to start creating mockups in Sketch. If you'd like to see a working prototype use the button below:
