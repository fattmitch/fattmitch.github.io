### Performance Website
---

#### Summary
Vista's old site was... unique (in an outdated, wood-grainy, cheesy graphic kind of way). They decided to redesign and rebrand their entire website. We were able to streamline and consolidate their content so that it is easy to digest and navigate, clearly showing the user where to go.

#### Braggin Rights
There's alot to love about the new Vista website, but my favorite feature is the footer. The cut out of their own unique hillside as a background is something that is entirely unique to them. In the age of the clean modern site, sometimes the footer is where you need to add a little flair, and that's just what this footer does.
