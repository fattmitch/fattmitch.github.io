# Strong Rock Camp
### Quick Deploy Site
---
#### Project Summary
Faced with a dying wordpress site, and limited resources, Strong Rock needed a site they knew was going to perform and be easy to manage. Enter the Typewriter templated solution. Skipping the design phase saved money, reduced time to launch, and ended with a faster, easier to use website.

#### Braggin Rights
My favorite aspect of the Strong Rock project was redesigning their navigation. A re-thought site map and simplified nav means more people getting the right info and signing up for camp.
