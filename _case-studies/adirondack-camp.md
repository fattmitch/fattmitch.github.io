# Adirondack Camp
### Signature Redesign
---
#### Project Summary
The Adirondack Camp Website redesign project was one of the more custom sites designed and developed by Ronningen Design. As lead designer on the project, designing something unique and custom while conforming to the Typewriter contraints is always a challenge but the end result is a unique site that performs well. 

#### Braggin Rights
The custom navigation was something that went through many revisions and evolutions. It was important to Adirondack Camp to have every page of the site easily accesible. The goal of the nav was to present the site map in a way that was easy to digest while highlighting the pages most important for users to vist.
