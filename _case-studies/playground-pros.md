#### Summary
What happens when you have an idea but not alot of branding to go with it? You get a designer's dream. Playground Pros is a new concept for a youth sports camp experience using existing school infrastructure. They were so new when I started on the project that I had a very long leash when it came to designing their site. 

#### Braggin Rights
This is one of my favorite sites I've designed during my time at Ronningen Design. I had alot of room to play and come  up with creative concepts (although I think I gave the development team a challenge!) I love the big bold font, the sports textures, and general athletic feel that the site has.
