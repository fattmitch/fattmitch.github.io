### Site Platform Change
---

#### Summary
There wasn't too much design work done here. We refined a few things and made some tweaks to the site navigation. This project was all about migrating an existing design over to a new platform (like Camp Champions).

#### Braggin Rights
This was one of the first sites where I really cut my teeth on working with the site code. Getting the CSS to line up with the newer markup and making things fit they way they used to was a blast and made me realize I wanted to get my hands on more development work.
