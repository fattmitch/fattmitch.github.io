### Wordpress Implementation
---

#### Summary
Takajo and Tripp lake camps needed new sites and were dead set on using Wordpress. Despite my own personal feeling about wordpress, it exists and people like it, so it's something any designer/developer needs to be familiar with. This was a fairly straight forward wordpress implementation with some custom elements to make the theme work for them.

#### Braggin Rights
I was able to customize the theme enough to provide them a degree of uniqueness from other templated wordpress sites. It's hard to be proud of any wordpress work, but I am happy with the end result, and so was the client.
