# Project: PayCrave

I get hungry. I get really hungry. Sometimes I don’t have time to go to a restraunt and order. Sometimes all I want is to order from a nearby food truck. Locating a food truck in the city can be cumbersom. Enter PayCrave. With PayCrave, I am able to locate all the food trucks just by using my location. I can browse, read reveiws, look at menus, and place an order, all from one mobile application.


PayCrave is a UX/UI mobile application design focusing on enabling users to find and order from foodtrucks.

## Locate:
---

I wanted PayCrave to be as simple as possible, so I designed to the homepage to default to a map view of all food trucks nearby. Users can toggle to view each food truck by proximity in a list view as well.

## Browse + Order:
---

Once a user decides on a specific food truck, they can get directions, see food truck hours and read reviews. All this information will help the user decide if they wanto move forward and place an order. Users can then toggle over to view the specific food truck’s menu. Users can see each food truck item and add it to their basket. Payment can be completed by tapping ‘Pay’ or by viewing their cart. Payment is completed just with the scan of a finger print.

## Manage:

Users can manage their account and see recent orders in the menu. Users can also leave reviews for each specific food truck after their order has been picked up.
