# Fortis AC
### Logo Creation
---

#### Summary
A brand new idea that turned into a brand new... brand. This brand new brand needed a brand new logo. Without any existing branding to build from, we developed a wordmark logo that could easily be plugged into various business applications.

#### Braggin Rights
Athletic? Check. Prestigious? Check. Adaptable? Yep. Looks good? Sure does. The logo(s) we developed will work great as this fledgling business starts to grow. Sometimes you just need to have something to start doing everything. I think this 'something' looks pretty clean and will serve them well as their business expands.
